This is the thing that updates the "node in the industry" section on the
node homepage, by picking 4 items at random.

## Hey!  We use node!  Can I get my company on here?

Probably!

Send your request in the form of a pull request.  It must add a folder
at `data/mycompany`, containing a `quote.html` file, and a `logo.png`
file.

The `quote.html` file should be just like the others: about 20
words explaining why node is a good fit at your company, from a
technical leader at your company, with a link to an appropriate page,
preferrably containing more info about your use of node.  Longer quotes
may be truncated or exerpted or rejected, at Joyent's sole discretion.
The HTML markup in the quote.html may be modified if necessary, at
Joyent's sole discretion.

The `logo.png` file MUST be 34px tall, and no more than 170px wide.  It
should be JUST your official company logo and the (R) or (TM) symbol,
in a single color: `rgb(210,216,186)` on `rgb(51,52,45)`, with appropriate
antialiasing.  It MUST NOT contain any additional texture, taglines,
highlighting.  It may be edited at Joyent's sole discretion to better
accomodate the needs of the web page design.

By submitting this request, you are giving Joyent, Inc. permission to
use the supplied logo on the "Node.js in the Industry" section of the
nodejs.org homepage, and to make any such modifications as Joyent deems
necessary or appropriate for the context.  Joyent is not obligated to
include your company logo and link on the nodejs.org home page, and will
do so at Joyent's sole discretion.

If you would like it removed, simply send a pull request removing it from
the git repository, and it will be pulled from the site promptly.

No other relationship between your company and Joyent is implied.
